              There are multiple types of ear infections. One of these
              infections, called swimmer's ear , are caused by bacterial in the
              ear
              <Emoji symbol="👂" />. It is called swimmer's ear because it is
              mostly caused by the water that remains in the ear after swimming
              <Emoji symbol="🏊" />.

              Keep your ears clean and dry; after showering, wipe them dry with your finger
              and a tissue.
