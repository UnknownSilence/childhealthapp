Inspiration
Meducate was born from the idea to provide convenient and easily consumable educational materials to sick or hospitalized children while maintaining their interest through visual illustrations and engaging games.

What it does
Meducate has two primary features:

An educational forum with easy-to-understand lessons regarding various common illnesses
An interactive game where children can apply their knowledge by choosing the best treatment method based on a Doctor's diagnosis. This allows children to apply their knowledge immediately in a simple but comprehensive way.
How we built it
The front-end and Interface of our Project were developed using the React framework for Javascript.

The back-end code was developed using Node.JS that encompassed the driving functions and the game's logic.

Most visual aids and graphic illustrations were developed by our graphic designer and integrated with the front-end code to facilitate a clean UX and child-friendly design scheme.

Challenges we ran into
Integration of our custom illustrations with the code was quite troublesome when attempting to stick to a singular design schematic. There were many creative approaches to the game and educational forum that also weren't possible due to the technological limitations of the React framework.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main focus of our Project was a clean and refined user experience that is very accessible and engaging for children. Ass such, it is our illustrations and UX that can be considered this project's greatest accomplishment.

What's next for Meducate
For the future, Meducate would focus on scalability for encompassing a greater range of topics. In addition, a wide variety of games for engagement would allow Meducate to maintain the interest of kids at even greater magnitudes.
